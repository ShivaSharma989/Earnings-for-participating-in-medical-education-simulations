## Project Title
Earnings for Participating in Medical Education Simulations

## Project Description
This smart contract allows participants to earn rewards for completing medical education simulations. By registering on the platform, participants can earn a specified reward (in Ether) for each simulation they complete. The contract tracks each participant's progress and rewards them accordingly. Admins can manage rewards and withdraw funds from the contract. This project aims to incentivize participants to engage with medical education content and promote learning through blockchain technology.
